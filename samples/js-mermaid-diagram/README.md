# Mermaid Diagram Web Part for SharePoint Online

## Summary

I created this web part to add **Mermaid diagram support** in SharePoint Online as part of my tutorial series. While working on it, I found this discussion thread: [Displaying Mermaid Diagrams in SharePoint Online Markdown Web Parts](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/sharepoint_general/displaying-mermaid-diagrams-in-sharepoint-online-markdown-web-parts/4043819), which highlights the need for a proper solution.

Since the native **Markdown web part in SharePoint Online does not support Mermaid diagrams**, I built this SPFx web part to enable rendering Mermaid syntax directly. I'm sharing this in case others find it useful or have suggestions for improvements.
