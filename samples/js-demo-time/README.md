# Demo Time

## Summary

This web part is more a POC created for the SharePoint Hackathon 2025.
This web part allows you to quickly add presentation mode to any page on your site.
It has no UI and is not visible after publish, so not edit mode of the page. After adding it to a page and publishing it will add an additional `Play` in the page header.

After we click on the `Play` button the web part will scroll to the first section to the page and will present the `Previous` and `Next` and `Stop` buttons which allow you to navigate through the page sections, treating each section as a slide.

It is also possible to use a custom `Demo Time` list which you may scaffolding using a CLI for Microsoft 365 script added to this sample. The list allows you to specific a comment which will be shown on a specific page for a specific section.

It is also possible to run this web part using the following keyboard shortcuts:
`ctrl` + `alt` + `p` - start presentation mode
`ctrl` + `alt` + `right arrow` - next section
`ctrl` + `alt` + `left arrow` - previous section
`ctrl` + `alt` + `s` - stop/end presentation mode

***‚ö†Ô∏è Please be aware***

This web part is using the page DOM as its API which is totally not recommended and may break without any notice from Microsoft side. The way it was created it will only work on communication sites when a specific class to find the page header was found.

## Minimal path to awesome

* Clone this repository (or [download this solution as a .ZIP file](https://pnp.github.io/download-partial/?url=https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/main/samples/js-demo-time) then unzip it)
* From your command line, change your current directory to the directory containing this sample (`js-demo-time`, located under `samples`)
* in the command line run:
  * `npm install`
  * `gulp serve`

Additionally to set comments for each section of a page you need to create the `Demo Time` list. You may do that using the PowerShell script added in the `scripts` folder. It uses [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/) commands which you need to have installed beforehand.
After you add the list to the site you may just populate it with comments for each section of every page you want and then the demo time web part during play mode will automatically find and show the comment for the current section.
