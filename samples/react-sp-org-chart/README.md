# Building Org Chart using a SharePoint list

## Summary

This Org Chart Web Part displays your organization's structure based on a custom list, starting from the top boss down to everyone else. Each person's card shows their name and job title, and when you click on someone, it highlights them so you can focus on where they sit in the company.
